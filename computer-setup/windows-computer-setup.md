Go to the extension store in VSCode and download the WSL extension. It should be produced by microsoft and have over 20M downloads

This is extremely important, and will let you use VSCode with your WSL for Linux

That's it for this one 😃

To test to see if it worked, go into your Ubuntu terminal and type in `which code`

As long as it doesn't say `command not found "code"` or something like that, then you are good to go ✅

## Install zgen

Run this command to clone down the files for zgen

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen.git "${HOME}/.zgen"
```

ZGen will make your terminal much nicer looking. Watch what happens after running a few commands.

To finish this installation, let's open our `zsh` configuration file by typing the following in Ubuntu

```zsh
code ~/.zshrc
```

Then you will copy and paste the following contents into the `.zshrc` configuration file and hit save

```zsh
source "${HOME}/.zgen/zgen.zsh"

zgen prezto
prompt steeef

# bun completions
[ -s "/root/.bun/_bun" ] && source "/root/.bun/_bun"

# bun
export BUN_INSTALL="$HOME/.bun"
export PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
# This loads nvm bash_completion
```

1. Launch VSCode and open the new VSCode terminal.
2. Click the dropdown menu next to the "plus" icon and select "Select default Profile". 14. Choose "Ubuntu (WSL)" from the list.

## NodeJS

Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable and high-performance applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, making it particularly well-suited for applications that require real-time communication and data-intensive tasks. Node.js enables developers to write server-side code using JavaScript, which reduces the complexity of having separate client-side and server-side languages. It has a vibrant ecosystem with a wide range of libraries and frameworks, which makes it a popular choice for web and network application development.

### Instructions to install Node.js with NVM

## GIT

GIT is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes, collaborate on projects, and manage source code effectively. It provides a way to keep a history of changes made to files, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed. GIT's decentralized architecture allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, independently making changes and merging them seamlessly. It also supports branching, which enables developers to work on separate features or experiments without affecting the main project, and later merge those branches back together. GIT has become an essential tool for software development, enabling teams to work collaboratively, track changes, and ensure code integrity.

GIT is already included in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), so there is no need for a separate installation. However, you may still need to configure GIT to work properly within the WSL environment and Github remote repos.

### Instructions to configure GIT

We've already installed Git earlier when we ran `sudo apt install xxx xxx git`. Git was one of the pieces of software that our package manager `apt` was installing.

Please verify that it is there by typing in.

`which git`

As long as it doesn't say 'Command Not Found' we're good to go

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/signup).
2. Open an Ubuntu Terminal (May be easier to copy / paste inside of VSCode)
3. Run the command `git config --global user.name "John Doe"` to set the default user name. **Make sure that you change this text to match your username that you used for github.**
4. Run the command `git config --global user.email name@domain.zone` to set the default email, which should match the email used during GitHub sign-up.**Make sure that you change this text to match your email that you used for github.**

5. Run the command `git config user.name` to verify that the user name is set correctly.
6. Run the command `git config user.email` to verify that the user email is set correctly.

### Instructions to set the SSH key for GITHUB

1. Launch the Ubuntu application.
2. Follow the [Generate new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=linux) instructions to generate a new SSH key. Ensure the "Linux" tab is active. Be sure to omit the "Generating a new SSH key for a hardware security key" section.
3. Follow the [Add a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account?platform=linux&tool=webui) instructions to add a new SSH key to your GitHub account. Ensure the "Linux" tab is active.

#### Test your SSH connection to Github

Run the command `ssh -T git@github.com` to test your connection to GitHub. Wait for the message "Hi user.name! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access."
