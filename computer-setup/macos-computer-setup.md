## Z Shell (ZSH)

ZSH, short for Z Shell, is an alternative shell to the widely used Bash shell in Unix-based operating systems. It offers a more powerful and customizable command-line experience with additional features such as advanced tab completion, spelling correction, plugin support, and extensive prompt customization options. ZSH also provides improved performance with optimizations and enhancements over the traditional Bash shell. With its user-friendly interface and extensive configurability, ZSH has become a popular choice among developers and power users for enhancing productivity and efficiency in the command-line environment.

### Get Started with ZSH

We will frequently use two commands in these instructions:

1. `which packageName` - This command will provide the path to the package if it is installed on the system. Otherwise, it will return either nothing or a message indicating that the package was not found.
2. `echo $SHELL` - This command will return the path to the package that is currently used as the default shell in your system.

### Instructions to check if ZSH is installed and set as the default shell

1. Launch the MacOS Terminal application.
2. Run the command `which zsh` to ensure it returns a path that ends with "/zsh".
3. Run the command `echo $SHELL` to ensure it returns a path that ends with "/zsh".

#### Options to proceed

- If the command `which zsh` didn't return any output or displayed "zsh not found," proceed to the [Instructions for installing Z Shell (ZSH)](#instructions-to-install-z-shell-zsh).
- If the command `echo $SHELL` returned a path that doesn't end with "/zsh," proceed to the [Instructions to switch the default shell to ZSH if the default shell is BASH](#instructions-to-switch-the-default-shell-to-zsh-if-the-default-shell-is-bash).
- If both commands returned paths that end with "/zsh," ZSH is properly set up. Please, SKIP the remaining ZSH instructions.

### Instructions to switch the default shell to ZSH if the default shell is BASH

1. Run the command `chsh -s $(which zsh)` to switch the default shell to ZSH.
2. Enter your user password when prompted by the Terminal app.
3. Restart the Terminal application.
4. Repeat the [Instructions to check if ZSH is installed and set as the default shell](#instructions-to-check-if-zsh-is-installed-and-set-as-the-default-shell)

### Instructions to install Z Shell (ZSH)

[Install Command Source](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/zsh#default)

1. Run the command `brew install zsh` to install the most recent version of Z Shell.
2. Follow the terminal instructions to finish the installing.
3. Run the command `which zsh` to ensure it returns the homebrew path to zsh package "/opt/homebrew/bin/zsh".
4. Run the command `chsh -s $(which zsh)` to change the default shell to ZSH.
5. Enter your user password when prompted by the Terminal app.

> If you didn't see a message saying "non-standard shell" after entering the password, please go to the [Instructions to check if ZSH is installed and set as the default shell](#instructions-to-check-if-zsh-is-installed-and-set-as-the-default-shell). Otherwise, continue:

6. Run the command `sudo echo "$(which zsh)" >> /etc/shells` to add the homebrew zsh package path to the list of shells.
7. Enter your user password when prompted by the Terminal app.

> If there was NO message saying "Permission denied" after you entered the password, please SKIP items 8 and 9 and move to 10.

8. Run the command `sudo sh -c "echo $(which zsh) >> /etc/shells"` to force adding the homebrew zsh package path to the list of shells.
9. Provide the terminal with the user password.
10. Repeat the [Instructions to check if ZSH is installed and set as the default shell](#instructions-to-check-if-zsh-is-installed-and-set-as-the-default-shell)

## GIT

GIT is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes, collaborate on projects, and manage source code effectively. It provides a way to keep a history of changes made to files, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed. GIT's decentralized architecture allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, independently making changes and merging them seamlessly. It also supports branching, which enables developers to work on separate features or experiments without affecting the main project, and later merge those branches back together. GIT has become an essential tool for software development, enabling teams to work collaboratively, track changes, and ensure code integrity.

GIT is already included in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), so there is no need for a separate installation. However, you may still need to configure GIT to work properly within the WSL environment and Github remote repos.

### Instructions to configure GIT

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/signup).
2. Launch the MacOS Terminal application.
3. Run the command `git config --global user.name "John Doe"` to set the default user name.
4. Run the command `git config --global user.email name@domain.zone` to set the default email, which should match the email used during GitHub sign-up.
5. Run the command `git config user.name` to verify that the user name is set correctly.
6. Run the command `git config user.email` to verify that the user email is set correctly.

### Instructions to update GIT to the latest version

1. Launch the MacOS Terminal application.
2. Run the commands in order:

```sh
brew install git
```

```sh
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
```

[Video guide on how to install GIT with Homebrew](https://www.loom.com/share/8c24b0f2369a477d98a680a123ebcbec?sid=cdf45803-597b-46b1-b7e8-2499520c27dc)

#### Test your GIT installation

1. Run the command `git --version` to check the installed version of Git.
2. Visit [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) to confirm that your Git version matches the latest available version.

### Instructions to set the SSH key for GITHUB

1. Launch the MacOS Terminal application.
2. Follow the [Generate new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=mac) instructions to generate a new SSH key. Be sure to omit the "Generating a new SSH key for a hardware security key" section.
